## Hi there! This is a little project that shows you my code example. I would like to show you what technologies I`m using in my daily work. 

## What this project about:

 * It's a presentation project to introduce my code approach.
 
 * If you are interested in what this project exactly about it's about sorts of beer =)


## Small description about the approach

 * The project based on React JavaScript library, the most popular and required JavaScript library in the world. 
 * The project contains:
 
   * `TypeScript`. What serious project doesn`t includes the TypeScript? The typization is the base of the good project.
   
   * `MobX 6`. A new version of the state manager that conquers its position from the Redux. In instead of Redux, MobX give us
     possibility to make changes in our state more quickly and safely to update using much less code for this. 
 
   * `Formik + Yup` (with my custom modifications that give us possibility to use formik custom context for the access to 
     the formik dynamic validation and values).
     
   * `Axios`. Library based on the "fetch" for more usable and flexible access to the API.
   
   * `Classnames`. Library that helps us to create dynamic classes for the HTML elements.
   
   * `QS`. Split any strings or objects by delimiter.
   
   * `Husky, Prettier, Jest` for the code flow controlling and testing.
   
   * `Custom hooks, helpers, references, and many many else`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
